# installation 
___

1. install "custom css and js loader" extension
2. download and copy the "custom" folder in your desired location
3. add the path of tweak.css and tweak.js inside your setting.json file

here is mine: 
```
"vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///C:/Users/hello/.vscode/custom/tweak.css",
    "file:///C:/Users/hello/.vscode/custom/tweak.js"
  ],
```

4. finally press ctrl+shift+p to open command palette and type "enable custom css and js" click on it.


if you are using my settings, then put this 'custom' folder inside C:\Users\userName\.vscode
and i recommand using aesthetic 3.0.0 theme with it. 
and also activate icon themes and product icon theme included with it as extension pack


note: this custom css is made specific for my settings so you might need to customize it for your self,
most of the changes are provided with proper comments.
